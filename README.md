INTRODUCTION
============

Enemy Territory: Legacy is based on the [raedwulf-et](https://bitbucket.org/tcmreastwood/raedwulf-et/)
project which in turn is based on the [GPL'd source code](https://github.com/id-Software/Enemy-Territory) of Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory.

The main goals of the project are fixing bugs, cleaning up the codebase and adding useful features
while remaining compatible with the ET 2.60b version.

The Legacy mod is the default mod shipped with ET: Legacy. It aims to add many useful features and
improvements, while staying close to the original gameplay, as well as being lightweight and extensible
through Lua scripts.

For more information consult our [changelog](https://dev.etlegacy.com/projects/etlegacy/wiki/Changelog).

ET: Legacy development is a collaborative effort done in an open, transparent and friendly manner.
Anyone is welcome to join our efforts!


### Donations

By request, we have finally managed to create a PayPal account for donations. So if you like the
ET: Legacy project or our game server, don't hesitate to send us some cash at **Paypal: etlegacy@liebt-dich.info**

Your contribution will be used to pay for our server and domain. To clarify, the project is not dependant
on donations. But we don't reject them if you want to honor our work. Thank you!


GENERAL NOTES
=============

### Game data

Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory is a free release, and can be downloaded from [Splash Damage](http://www.splashdamage.com/content/download-wolfenstein-enemy-territory).

This source release contains only the engine and mod code but not any game data,
which is still covered by the original EULA and must be obeyed as usual.

In order to run ET: Legacy you will need to copy the original assets files
(*pak0.pk3*, *pak1.pk3* and *pak2.pk3*) to the etmain folder.


### Compatibility with Enemy Territory 2.60b

ET: Legacy remains compatible with the ET 2.60b version as much as possible.

Please note that ET: Legacy is *not* compatible with PunkBuster enabled servers.
ET: Legacy clients also cannot connect to servers running the ETPro mod.


### Linux 64 bit

Please remember that 64 bit ET: Legacy clients can only connect to servers running
mods providing a 64 bit version. You will be able to play 32 bit-only mods only if
you compile ET: Legacy on a 32 bit system or crosscompile it for 32 bit architecture
on a 64 bit system.

At the moment, only the Legacy mod is available in 64 bit version, while all other
existing mods are available in 32 bit only version.

In case you are a running a 64 bit system, you probably might want to use the
**bundled libraries** which are located in a separate *etlegacy-libs* repository and
can be automatically downloaded using the `git submodule` command. See the next
section for more details.


DEPENDENCIES
============

* **CMake** (compile-time only)
* **OpenGL**
* **GLEW**
* **SDL**
* **ZLib**
* **MiniZip**
* **libjpeg-turbo** or **libjpeg**
* **libcurl** (optional, enabled by default)
* **Lua** (optional, enabled by default)
* **Ogg Vorbis** (optional, enabled by default)
* **Theora** (optional, enabled by default)
* **Freetype** (optional, enabled by default)
* **SQLite** (optional, enabled by default)
* **OpenAL** (optional, enabled by default)
* **Jansson** (optional)


Grab info about current lib versions from our wiki page [ET: Legacy Libs_Changelog](https://dev.etlegacy.com/projects/etlegacy/wiki/Libs_Changelog)

To get the latest source code install [git](http://git-scm.com/) and
clone our repository hosted at [Github.com](https://github.com/etlegacy/etlegacy):

    $ git clone git://github.com/etlegacy/etlegacy.git

If the required dependencies are not installed on your system run:

    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update

This downloads the essential dependencies into the `libs/`directory. You can choose
whether to use bundled libraries instead of the system ones by changing the
`BUNDLED_LIBS` variable in the CMakeList.txt configuration file. You can then select
which bundled libraries to use by toggling the respective `BUNDLED_XXX` variable.


COMPILE AND INSTALL
===================

To install the binaries system-wide, you need to compile ET: Legacy with hardcoded
fs_basepath.

The following variables can be adjusted in CMake:

  * **INSTALL_DEFAULT_BASEDIR**: sets default *fs_basepath*, i.e. where etl and etlded
    executables look for data files. In most cases it is CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX+INSTALL_DEFAULT_MODDIR.
    Defaults to empty value, because we want *fs_basepath* to be the current working directory
    when not installing the game system-wide.

  * (optional) **INSTALL_DEFAULT_BINDIR**: Location for executables. Appended to CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.
    Defaults to "bin".

  * (optional) **INSTALL_DEFAULT_MODDIR**: Location for libraries and paks. Appended to
    CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. Defaults to "share/etlegacy" and then "legacy" is appended to it.


### Linux

Install required dependencies.

* option A: **easybuild**

In terminal, run:

    $ ./easybuild.sh

ET: Legacy will be installed in `~/etlegacy`.

* option B: **command line**

In terminal, run:

    $ mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..

To compile, run:

    $ make

If you wish to install ET: Legacy system-wide, run:

    # make install

Be sure to set the CMake variables (see above) beforehand.


**NOTES:**

  * Even if you have a 64 bit linux distribution which provides 32 bit versions of all
  the required libraries, you might also need the development libraries (-devel packages)
  installed on your system.

  * In order to compile the jpeg-turbo library properly you will need the **nasm** assembler.


### Crosscompiling on Linux with MinGW-w64

In terminal, run:

    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/Toolchain-cross-mingw-linux.cmake ..
    $ make

By default, MinGW name is set to *i686-w64-mingw32*. You may have to change it in
`cmake/Toolchain-cross-mingw-linux.cmake` depending on how it is called on your system.


### Windows

Install:

  1. [Visual Studio Community](http://www.visualstudio.com/)
  2. [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) and make sure it is added to your system PATH

* option A: **easybuild**

    1. run easybuild.bat

ET: Legacy will be installed in `My Documents\ETLegacy-Build`.

* option B: **Visual Studio**

    1. create a `build` directory inside the directory which contains ET: Legacy sources
    2. open *Visual Studio Command Prompt* in the Start menu
    3. change directory with `cd` to the newly created build directory

In the command prompt, run:

    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -DBUNDLED_LIBS=YES .. && nmake

or

    cmake -G "Visual Studio 10" -DBUNDLED_LIBS=YES ..

and open the resulting project in Visual Studio.


**NOTES:**

  * If compilation of bundled libraries is aborted for any reason, you will probably need to clean the
  libs directory and start over. This can be done by executing `git clean -df && git reset --hard HEAD`
  inside `libs/` directory.

  * If the build fails during libcurl compilation because of missing *sed* utility, download it from
  [GnuWin](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/sed.htm) and place it into your system path or
  copy it into `MSVC/VC/bin`. It also comes with Git and can be placed into your system path
  automatically if you select that option during Git installation.

  * In order to compile the jpeg library properly there is a need for a file named 'win32.mak'.
  Unfortunately this file isn't shipped with Windows 8.0 and 8.1 SDK versions.
  Solution: Get the Windows SDK 7 and copy 'win32.mak' to `libs/jpeturbo/`.

  * Compiling renderer 2 on Windows requires GNU sed (gsed) to be installed. It can be downloaded
  from the [GnuWin](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/sed.htm) website.


### Mac OS X

Install:

    1. [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/)
    2. [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
    3. [Homebrew Cask](http://caskroom.io/)

Then brew the following packages in the terminal app:

    $ brew cask install xquartz
    $ brew install --universal gnu-sed cmake glew sdl2 minizip jpeg-turbo curl lua libogg libvorbis libtheora freetype sqlite openal-soft

The --universal flag ensures both 32bit and 64bit libraries are installed. Although your system curl library supports both architectures, you also need to install its headers.

* option A: **easybuild**

In Terminal, run:

    $ ./easybuild.sh

This will put an 'etlegacy' folder into your user folder.

* option B: **command line**

In terminal, run:

    $ mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..

To compile, run:

    $ make

If you wish to install ET: Legacy system-wide, run:

    # make install

Be sure to set the CMake variables (see above) beforehand.


**NOTES**:

  * In the legacy mod folder, the cgame_mac and ui_mac files are redundant since they are in the 
  etl_bin.pk3 and will be extracted at runtime, so you can delete those. The client is named etl.app
  (and can safely be renamed), while the dedicated server is just a command-line binary named "etlded".

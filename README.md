This fork is for the OpenPandora, bringing ARM compatibility and GLES renderer

INTRODUCTION
============

ET: Legacy is based on the [raedwulf-et project](https://bitbucket.org/tcmreastwood/raedwulf-et/) 
which in turn is based on the GPL'd source code of Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory. 

Its main goal is to fix bugs and clean up the codebase while remaining 
compatible with the ET 2.60b version.

GENERAL NOTES
=============

Game data and patching:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory is a free release, and can be downloaded from
http://www.splashdamage.com/content/download-wolfenstein-enemy-territory

This source release contains only the engine and mod code and not any game data, 
the game data is still covered by the original EULA and must be obeyed as usual.

Compatibility with Enemy Territory 2.60b
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please remember that only if you compile ET:L on a 32bit system or crosscompile it
for 32bit architecture on a 64bit system will you be able to play on 2.60b servers.

In case you are a running a 64bit system, you will probably want to use the 
**bundled libraries** which are located in a separate *etlegacy-libs* repository and
can be automatically downloaded using the `git submodule` command. See the next section 
for more details.

NOTE: Even if you have a 64bit linux distribution which provides 32bit versions of all
the required libraries, cURL library also needs source code (package with -devel suffix) 
configured for the different architecture and it is rarely packaged on 64bit distributions.

Dependencies
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **CMake** (compile-time only)
* **libSDL**, version 1.2
* **libjpeg**, version 8 is required, version 6 won't compile!
* **lua**, either version 5.2 or 5.1 (optional)
* **libcurl** (optional, enabled by default)
* **OGG Vorbis File** (optional)
* **OpenAL** (optional)
* **OpenGL**
* **Freetype** (optional)

To get the latest source code install [git](http://git-scm.com/) and
clone our repository hosted at Github.com:

    $ git clone git://github.com/etlegacy/etlegacy.git

If the required dependencies are not installed on your system run:

    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update

This downloads the essential dependencies (libjpeg, libSDL and libcurl) into the `libs/`
directory. You can choose whether to use bundled libraries instead of the system ones by
changing the `BUNDLED_LIBS` variable in the CMake configuration. You can then select which
bundled libraries to use by toggling the respective `BUNDLED_XXX` variable.

Compile and install
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Linux

In terminal run:

    $ mkdir build && cd build && cmake-gui ..

If you do not wish to install ET:L system-wide simply run:

    $ make

To install the binaries system-wide, you need to compile ET:L with hardcoded fs_basepath.

First adjust the following variables in CMake:
  * **INSTALL_DEFAULT_BASEDIR**: sets default *fs_basepath*, i.e. where etl and etlded
    executables look for data files. In most cases it is CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX+INSTALL_DEFAULT_MODDIR.
    Defaults to empty value, because we want *fs_basepath* to be the current working directory
    when not installing the game system-wide.
  * (optional) **INSTALL_DEFAULT_BINDIR**: Location for executables. Appended to CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.
    Defaults to "bin".
  * (optional) **INSTALL_DEFAULT_MODDIR**: Location for libraries and paks. Appended to
    CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. Defaults to "share/etlegacy" and then "etmain" is appended to it.

Then compile ET:L:

	$ make
	# make install

### Crosscompiling on linux with mingw32

In terminal run:

    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/Toolchain-cross-mingw32-linux.cmake ..
    $ make

Mingw32 name is set to *i686-pc-mingw32* by default. You may have to change that
in `cmake/Toolchain-cross-mingw32-linux.cmake` depending on how it is called on your system.

### Windows

* option A: **Visual Studio**

    1. download free Visual Studio C++ Express 2010
    2. when you install CMake, make sure it is added into your system PATH
    3. create `build` directory inside the directory which contains ET:L sources
    4. open `Visual Studio Command Prompt (2010)` (search for it in the Start menu) and `cd` to the newly created build directory
    5. run `cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -DBUNDLED_LIBS=YES .. && nmake`
       ... or `cmake -G "Visual Studio 10" ..` and open the resulting project in VS 2010

* option B: open the CMakeLists.txt file in [QT Creator](http://qt.nokia.com/products/developer-tools).

NOTE: In order to compile the jpeg library properly there is a need for a file named 'win32.mak'. 
Unfortunately this file isn't shipped with later Windows SDK versions. Solution: Get the Windows 
SDK 6 and copy 'win32.mak' to libs\jpeg\.

NOTE: If build fails during libcurl compilation because of missing *sed* utility,
download it from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/sed.htm and place it into
your system path or copy it into MSVC/VC/bin. It also comes with Git and can be placed
into your system path automatically if you select that option during Git installation.

If compilation of bundled libraries is aborted for any reason, you will probably need to clean libs/ directory
and start over. This can be done by executing `git clean -df && git reset --hard HEAD` inside libs/ directory.

INTRODUCTION
============

ET: Legacy is an open source project based on the code of Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, which was released in 2010 under
the terms of General Public License v3.

Set during World War II and heavily focused on team work, the game was initially released in 2003 by Splash Damage and
id Software. More than a decade after its release, after spending countless hours of escorting tanks and trucks,
stealing gold and radar parts and transmitting confidential documents, it was time to dust off the game which
consistently refused to go down.

Ambition
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are two aspects to this project: an updated game version "Enemy Territory: Legacy" and a new mod "legacy".

* The main goal of ET: Legacy is to fix bugs and security exploits, remove old dependencies, add useful features and
  modernize its graphics while still remaining compatible with ET 2.60b and as many of its mods as possible.
* The main goal of legacy is to stay close to the original gameplay experience and provide a viable alternative to ETPro
  for competitive play while staying lightweight but extensible through additional Lua scripts.

Community
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Under the wing of ET: Legacy, players from all corners of the Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory community came together to
continuously update a game that is well over a decade old, which despite its considerable age is still home to hundreds
of concurrent players a day. ET: Legacy development is a collaborative effort done in an open, transparent and friendly
manner. We do appreciate any contribution to the project may it be in the form of patches, suggestions, reports or
comments.

Anyone is welcome to join our efforts!
